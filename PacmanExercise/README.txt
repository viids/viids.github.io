In this Exercise the goal is to move the packman around, detect the edges of the window and reverse the movement direction based on that.
The project file structure is:
	-images folder:This folder contains the images representing Pac-Man at different stages (mouth open, mouth closed).
	-index.html: This is the HTML file that displays the Pac-Man.
	-style.html: This contains the style classes declared for various elements used in index file.

For future improvements I am thinking about mixing the mouse eents with the movement direction. One can also mix Pacman Factory Exercise with mouse-driven movement and create fun game.
