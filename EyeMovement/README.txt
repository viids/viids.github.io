In this Exercise the goal is to wok with mouse events; These events include but are not limited to click, mousemove and mouseleave.
The project file structure is:
	-eye.js:This file contains the javascript code that controls the eyemovement based on mouse events.
	-index.html: This is the HTML file that displays the eyes.
	-style.html: This contains the style classes declared for various elements used in index file.

For future improvements I am thinking about different eye behaviours based on different mouse events.
