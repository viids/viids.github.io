In this exercise the goal is to work with a mapping library to pull in data asynchronously and display map elements.
To Run this project and an aPIcall to ... is required; as well as an account on ....
The project file structure is:
	-mapanimation.js:TThis file contains the javascript code that receives the data, parse it and use it to animate the moving of the bus.
	-index.html:  This is the HTML file that displays the movement of the bus.
	-style.html: This contains the style classes declared for various elements used in index file.

For future improvements I am thinking about different eye behaviours based on different mouse movements.
